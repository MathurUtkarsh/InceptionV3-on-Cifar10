# InceptionV3-on-Cifar10

InceptionV3 is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed by Google, which was trained on the ImageNet dataset. It can be used for image classification tasks and has been shown to perform well on a variety of image classification benchmarks.

Cifar10 is a widely used dataset for image classification that consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Using InceptionV3 on Cifar10 dataset would involve the following steps:

1. Preprocessing the data: The Cifar10 images need to be preprocessed before feeding them to the InceptionV3 model. This includes converting the images to the format      that the model expects, and normalizing the pixel values.

2. Loading the pre-trained InceptionV3 model: The InceptionV3 model can be loaded from the Keras library, which already has the pre-trained weights on the ImageNet        dataset.

3. Fine-tuning the InceptionV3 model: The InceptionV3 model can be fine-tuned on the Cifar10 dataset by unfreezing some layers and training them with the Cifar10 data.    This step can help the model to learn more specific features that are useful for the Cifar10 dataset.

4. Training the model: The model can be trained on the Cifar10 dataset using the appropriate optimizer and loss function.

5. Evaluating the model: The trained model can be evaluated on the test set of the Cifar10 dataset to measure its performance.

6. Deploying the model: The trained model can be deployed in a production environment to make predictions on new images
